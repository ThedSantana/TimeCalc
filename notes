- Figure out how to swipe list items to delete them
    - Checkout RecyclerView, see https://developer.android.com/training/material/lists-cards.html

    - Optimize which views are invalidated when entries change

- Consider using JSON (Gson) for data storage (simplifies serialization) - or any alternatives?
