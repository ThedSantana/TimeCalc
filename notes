* Clean up setup of the item touch helper
- Activity should register as adapter data observer for updating the result
    - use registerAdapterDataObserver(RecyclerView.AdapterDataObserver observer)

> Figure out how to swipe list items to delete them
    * Checkout RecyclerView, see https://developer.android.com/training/material/lists-cards.html
    * See ItemTouchHelper for swiping items, https://medium.com/@ipaulpro/drag-and-swipe-with-recyclerview-b9456d2b1aaf#.9zmbm6jrp
    * When moving items, the item is transparent, so probably the background should be set to the standard color
    * When swiping, some background indicating that the entry is being deleted should be shown
    - Clicking items - maybe something simpler is available?

* Consider using JSON (Gson) for data storage (simplifies serialization)

* Saving and restoring should only be performed when necessary, see lifetime diagram on
  https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html
    * Initial setup should happen in onCreate (adapter etc.)
    * Restoring should happen in both onCreate and onRestart
    * Saving should happen in onPause
